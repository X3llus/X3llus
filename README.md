I'm currently working on my [portfolio website](https://github.com/X3llus/portfolio), where i'm trying to learn how to use Angular and Typescript for cool functionality.

I'm also learning about PWA's for some upcoming private projects that I'll be working on.

You can reach me at http://bradencoates.ca/#/contact
